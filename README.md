echo "# BANG420 Assignment Submission

## Getting Started

You can start this assignment by following these steps:

### 1. Create and enter your project directory
\`\`\`bash
mkdir salary-project && cd salary-project
\`\`\`

---

### 2. Open the directory in Visual Studio Code
While inside the directory, run:
\`\`\`bash
code .
\`\`\`
This will open the folder in Visual Studio Code.  
Inside VS Code, create a file named:
\`\`\`
salary_assignment.ipynb
\`\`\`

You’ll also need to **install the Python Notebook extension** in VS Code to be able to run \`.ipynb\` files.  
*(This should be done before working with R.)*

---

### 3. Install required packages

Before running your code, make sure you have the necessary packages installed.

#### Option 1: Local machine (Linux with sudo access)
\`\`\`bash
sudo apt install python3-pandas
\`\`\`

#### Option 2: Virtual Machine or environment
\`\`\`bash
pip install notebook
jupyter notebook
\`\`\`

---

### 4. Running the Notebook
When you execute the cells in \`salary_assignment.ipynb\`, it will generate the following files:

1. \`Employee_Profile.zip\`
2. \`construction_payroll.csv\`

---

### 5. Running the R Script
An R file (\`unzip_and_display.R\`) is provided to automatically **unzip** the \`Employee_Profile.zip\` file created by your Python code.

---

## How to Run

1. Execute all cells in:
\`\`\`bash
salary_assignment.ipynb
\`\`\`
2. Then run:
\`\`\`bash
Rscript unzip_and_display.R
\`\`\`

---

## Files

- **Python Notebook**: \`salary_assignment.ipynb\`
- **R Script**: \`unzip_and_display.R\`
- **Sample Data**: \`construction_payroll.csv\`
- **Output**: \`Employee_Profile.zip\`

---

## ✅ FULLY COMPLETED TASKS

**As instructed**
- Import Data ✅ — Used \`construction_payroll.csv\` in Python  
- Create Employee Function ✅ — Implemented \`get_employee_details(name)\` in Jupyter  
- Data Processing with Dictionary ✅ — Used \`employee_dict = df.to_dict("index")\`  
- Error Handling ✅ — Added try/except in lookup and export functions  
- Export Employee Details ✅ — \`export_employee()\` creates CSV + ZIP  

**From the instruction**
- Unzip and Display with R ✅ — \`unzip_and_display.R\` works with Python's ZIP output  

**From WhatsApp Image 2025-08-10 at 6.38.24 PM.jpeg:**
- Jupyter Notebook ✅ — \`salary_assignment.ipynb\` covers all Python tasks  
- GitHub Submission ✅ — All files are in your \`~/salary-project/\` directory  
- README.md ✅ — Created with full instructions (see above)
